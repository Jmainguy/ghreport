# ghreport

Application to check Github for Pull Requests, that are not Drafts, in repos the user cares about.

## Usage
The program is configured via a YAML file located at `$HOME/.config/ghreport/config.yaml`.

* token: Should be set to a Github API Token with access to the repos you are checking
    * Set permissions for token to repo - full control of private repositories, enable SSO if your repos require it
    * ![Github Personal Access Token Permissions](https://github.com/Jmainguy/ghreport/blob/main/docs/permissions.png?raw=true)
* One of subscribedRepos, autoDiscover.organizations, or autoDiscover.users must be set if you wish to have any results. You can set all three if you wish.
* topic limits what is returned from organizations and users to just that topic, this is an optional field.

Here's an example configuration:

```yaml
autoDiscover:
  organizations:
    - name: your_organization_name
      topic: topic_to_watch
  users:
    - name: your_username
      topic: topic_to_watch
subscribedRepos:
  - Jmainguy/ghreport
  - Jmainguy/bible
  - Jmainguy/ghReview
  - Jmainguy/bak
token: e0e9eac4e84446df6f3db180d07bfb222e91234
```
